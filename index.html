            <h3>
              “Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches
              you how to think" Steve Jobs-1995
            </h3>
            <p>
              That phrase was on a wall in the University, and also was my first
              phrase related to programming that I have kept since I watched it.
              I didn’t know what will happen in my first quarter or even in my
              first class but trust me when you get into this world you will
              never want to go out. </br>  </br>I love programming, but my favorite part is
              “the solution to any problem”. And here’s why, because we have
              many different ways to solve one problem. And that’s why you will
              never stop learning. </br> </br> I was not a creative person, but this makes
              me a person who thinks in different ways or even I see my problems
              differently than before. I already understand that my problems
              have more than only 1 solution. I just need to breathe and think
              about the best way to solve them! </br> </br> For those and other reasons, I
              am here, writing this, to learn, to make my best, and to be the
              best programmer that I can be.
